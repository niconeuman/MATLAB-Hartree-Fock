# MATLAB-Hartree-Fock
A Hartree-Fock program developed in Matlab. It uses Obara-Saika recursion relations together with horizontal and electron-transfer recursion relations for electron repulsion (ERI) and other integrals. These relations are vectorized at high-level, and their efficiency is being tested.
Disclaimer (June 1st 2021)
This program is not fully functional. It may run but there are bugs within it that I haven't been able to fix, and don't have time to for the moment.
There are more advanced versions of this program which I've been developing but haven't uploaded to GitHub.
If anyone wants to use this please go ahead, and if anyone wants to discuss the possible bugs and give me hand in fixing them, they are more than welcome.
