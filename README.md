# MATLAB-Hartree-Fock
A Hartree-Fock program developed in Matlab. It uses Obara-Saika recursion relations together with horizontal and electron-transfer recursion relations for electron repulsion (ERI) and other integrals. These relations are vectorized at high-level, and their efficiency is being tested.
